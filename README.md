# UFO Sightings 

## Overview 
to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time
In addition to the date, you’ll add table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
Create dynamic webpages by inserting javascript into HTML script
CSS and bootstrap and chrome dev tools


### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis 
Using JavaScript and HTML, you’ll modify the code in your index.html file to create more table filters

Using JavaScript, you’ll replace the handleClick() function in your app.js file with a new function that saves the element, value, and id of the filter that was changed. Then, you’ll create a new function to loop through the dataset and keep only the results that match the search criteria. The webpage will be updated with the search criteria after pressing "Enter".



## Analysis 

Data Source: [UFO Sightings Data Set](static/js/data.js)

Software used: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code v1.52.1

Analysis: 

## Results
 
[//]: # "Describe to Dana how someone might use the new webpage by walking her through the process of using the search criteria. Use images of your webpage during the filtering process to support your explanation. There is a description of how to perform a search, with images."

This webpage loads with the entire data set in the form of a table (![fig1](Resources/)). The user can filter the table for the following criteria: date, city, state, country, shape. These filter criterias can be enter in the text box provided(![fig2](Resources/)). Faint text in the text box shows examples of formats for the search criteria. For example, state search box takes in the state codes, countries takes in country codes and format for the date is dd/mm/yyyy. All search criteria may be entered in lower case. 


## Summary

[//]: # "In a summary statement, describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development"


### Drawbacks of this design
Drawbacks of this design: 
- limited filter capability. 
- removing filters is difficult. 
- cannot filter by multiple criteria, 
- 

### Ideas for futher development
There is a number of ways this code can be further developed:
- being able to select multiple cities for filters at the same time. 
- being able to filter by range of dates
- being able to filter by 
- adding a clear all filters button 
- having active filter tags visible on top the filters 
- being able to clear filter tags individually.
